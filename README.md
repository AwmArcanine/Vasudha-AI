# 🌍 Deep Learning Optimization in Earth Observation for Imbalanced Datasets

This project was built for the ISRO Hackathon 2025, focusing on improving the detection of **rare events** (e.g., water bodies, landslides) in **Earth Observation (EO)** satellite imagery using **deep learning** techniques.

Our goal is to handle the **class imbalance problem** commonly found in EO data using a combination of:
- Advanced data augmentation,
- Balanced loss functions,
- Attention mechanisms,
- Synthetic oversampling strategies.

## 🧠 Problem Overview

Standard deep learning models underperform when classes are imbalanced — which is typical in EO imagery. This affects detection of rare classes like small water bodies or deforestation patches. Our solution integrates:

- **Synthetic oversampling** for rare classes  
- **Focal and Dice loss** to focus learning  
- **Attention-enhanced architectures** for better feature extraction

## 🧑‍💻 Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Task |
|------|------|

## 📊 Metrics We Track

- **IoU (Intersection over Union)** – Per-class and mean  
- **F1-Score** – Focus on rare classes  
- **Recall** – For sensitivity on underrepresented regions  
- **Confusion Matrix** – For visual inspection of class confusion
